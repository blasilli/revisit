# Introduction

Welcome to the user study on **Visualization Rhetoric and Misleading Visualizations**. In this study, you will analyze a series of Twitter posts that contain visualizations which have been identified as misleading. Your task is to evaluate the rhetorical techniques used in these visualizations that support the misleading aspect and assess whether the misleading aspects appear to be intentional or accidental.

## Study Overview
You are provided with **10 Twitter posts**, each containing a **misleading visualization**. These visualizations were previously identified as misleading because they exhibit one or more **visual design** or **reasoning errors**. Each chart is accompanied by metadata describing the type of misleader involved (e.g., cherry-picking, truncated axis, dual axis, causal inference). 

These misleading Twitter posts were collected from  [Lisnic, Polychronis, Lex, and Kogan. Misleading Beyond Visual Tricks: How People Actually Lie with Charts. CHI 2024. DOI 10.1145/3544548.3580910](https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580910)

## Your Task
Your task consists of two parts:

1. Identify the **rhetorical techniques** used to mislead. 
2. Assess **intentionality to mislead**: determine whether the misleading aspect appears to be **intentional or accidental**.

Remember to use the supplemental material provided to familiarize yourself with common types of misleading visualizations errors and rhetorical techniques.
