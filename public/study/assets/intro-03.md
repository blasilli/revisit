## 🗂 What You Will See in Each Task

Each visualization page follows the same structure, consising of a Tweet with error description, and fixed questions.

---

### Tweet & Error Description

At the top of each page, the detected **misleading error** is shown with a short explanation.

Below that, you will see the original tweet embedded.

Example:

<p>
  <img src="./study/assets/guide-tweet.png"
       style="width:50%; border:2px solid black; padding:4px; border-radius:4px;">
</p>

You can **resize the embedded tweet image** using the handle below the image.

### Questions

After reviewing the definitions, you will answer three mandatory questions. And optional comments at the end.

---


#### Q1 — Author Intent and Factors

> **Q1** - Which **author's intentions** may have **contributed** to making this visualization **misleading**, and how significant is each one's contribution?  

---

#### Q2 — Overall Intentionality Judgment

> **Q2** - Overall, how much do you think the **misleading aspects** of this visualization may have been **intentional**, rather than **accidental** (unintentional)?
